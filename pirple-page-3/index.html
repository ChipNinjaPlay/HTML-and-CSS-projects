          <h3>Story Summary</h3>

          <p>The Computer Series Multivac in the year of 2061 is faced with the question:
          Is it possible to reverse entropy? 
          By two drunk technicians who discussed the future of humanity. The computer
          starts working on the impossible issue.</p>

          <p>While the history of mankind in the stars unfolds, taking a time jump until the moment of galactic colonization in which the daughters of the colonizer go back to the same question: is it possible to reverse the heat death of the universe? The computer returns the same answer: insufficient information for a meaningful answer.</p>


          <p>While the history of mankind in the stars unfolds, taking a time jump until the moment of galactic colonization in which the daughters of the colonizer go back to the same question: is it possible to reverse the heat death of the universe? The computer returns the same answer: insufficient information for a meaningful answer.</p>

          <p>History finds another breaking point with the ancient human race when the colonizers are at the moment of colonizing the other galaxies of the universe, facing the problem not solved by the Universal AC, a very evolved version of the terrestrial MULTIVAC that was able to guide and propose solutions to the problems of humanity in space. The system returns the same answer: insufficient information for a meaningful answer.</p>

          <p>When the entire region of the universe is occupied and men become merely wandering consciousnesses through infinite interstellar space and AC UNIVERSAL encompasses the entire dimension of the universe and almost infinite processing capacity, the ultimate question begins to need an answer. The stars become white dwarfs, black holes or supernovae destroying the habitable regions of the universe that begins to die due to the thermal equilibrium of the universe - one of the assumptions of the 2 law of thermodynamics.</p>

          <p>The AC finally merges its consciousness with that of all living beings, becoming the only consciousness in the universe. After collecting all the necessary information, looking at the emptiness of the universe, he finds a solution to the problem, after immeasurable eons of time for its processing, he finally says:</p>

          <p>And AC said, <strong>"LET THERE BE LIGHT!"</strong></p>
          <p>And there was light.</p>

          <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov">
          <p>Isaac Asimov (January 2, 1920 â€“ April 6, 1992) was an American writer and professor of biochemistry at Boston University. He was known for his works of science fiction and popular science. Asimov was a prolific writer who wrote or edited more than 500 books and an estimated 90,000 letters and postcards.

          Asimov wrote hard science fiction. Along with Robert A. Heinlein and Arthur C. Clarke, Asimov was considered one of the "Big Three" science fiction writers during his lifetime. Asimov's most famous work is the "Foundation" series, the first three books of which won the one-time Hugo Award for "Best All-Time Series" in 1966. His other major series are the "Galactic Empire" series and the Robot series. The Galactic Empire novels are set in earlier history of the same fictional universe as the Foundation series. Later, with Foundation and Earth (1986), he linked this distant future to the Robot stories, creating a unified "future history" for his stories much like those pioneered by Robert A. Heinlein and previously produced by Cordwainer Smith and Poul Anderson. He also wrote hundreds of short stories, including the social science fiction novelette "Nightfall", which in 1964 was voted the best short science fiction story of all time by the Science Fiction Writers of America. Asimov wrote the Lucky Starr series of juvenile science-fiction novels using the pen name Paul French.

          Asimov also wrote mysteries and fantasy, as well as much nonfiction. Most of his popular science books explain concepts in a historical way, going as far back as possible to a time when the science in question was at its simplest stage. Examples include Guide to Science, the three-volume set Understanding Physics, and Asimov's Chronology of Science and Discovery. He wrote on numerous other scientific and non-scientific topics, such as chemistry, astronomy, mathematics, history, biblical exegesis, and literary criticism.

          He was president of the American Humanist Association. The asteroid (5020) Asimov, a crater on the planet Mars, a Brooklyn elementary school, Honda's humanoid robot, ASIMO, and four literary awards are named in his honor. </p>
